# Dataset Information

The complete dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. However, you can replicate the MIDI generation locally using:

1. The generator, renderer, and raw_to_training files in `/datasets_processing`

All necessary parameters and random seeds are stored in the configuration files.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Upload a sample dataset to an external platform (e.g., Kaggle)
- [ ] Create an API wrapper for easier access and referencing
